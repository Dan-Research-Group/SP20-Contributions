## Name: Qitian Liao
## SID: 3031980823
## Done: 
I finished implementing and integrating the following five questions from past CS10 Midterms to PrairieLearn. 
More detailed information, specific description about the implementation and a brief demo of each question can be found in the readme file on my Github (Link provided below). 
Sign and Magnitude (Summer 2019, Question 5) 
Number Division (Fall 2019, Question 6) 
Number Multiplication (Spring 2019, Question 6) 
Speed Up (Summer 2019, Question 5) 
Number Division (Fall 2019, Question 6) 
## Doing:
Mainly two things. First, I am implementing the hint algorithm on Prairielearn which should direct students towards the correct solution. Second, I am also implementing more questions from past midterms. 
## Will Do: 
I will continue to do what I mentioned above. Furthermore, I will be prepared to implement new features we might think of next semester.
