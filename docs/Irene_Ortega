Done:
    I implemented the buggy question (Midterm Fall 2019) with images, and demo (JSON version)
    Snap!Con proposal ideas https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QLk7tFv7UoYyCOEXreMYdDKB8jDNVlHICnxgqvqM5Wc/edit?usp=sharing
    Applied and received a $500 grant for our project through UC LEADS 
    Took notes on meetings until Dan took over
    

Doing:
    Helping set up a hierarchical structure to reduce repeated code
    Updating our Snap! Image generator to have a faster runtime. Our current one takes long because it drags blocks to create an image.
    Translating Json to PrairieLearn output, making sure code does not break abstraction barriers for our hierarchical structure
    

Will do:
This Summer I plan on spending about 30 hrs/ week creating more question generators for different question types in CS10. 
I also hope to have a solid concept map that we can all access and edit. 
I will also dedicate my time to polishing our proposal, getting our poster ready, and preparing a demo for Snap!Con.
